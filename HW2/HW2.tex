\section{Interpretations and Models}
For each of the solutions provided below assume that $D = N$, $zero_\mathscr{I} = 0$, and $s_\mathscr{I} :=$ the successor function over $N$.
\subsection{Part A}

1. $p_\mathscr{I} = \{n \in N$ $|$ $n$ is even$\}$.\\
2. $p_\mathscr{I} = N$.

\subsection{Part B}

1. $q_\mathscr{I} = \{n \in N$ $|$ $n$ is odd$\}$.\\
2. $q_\mathscr{I} = N$.

\subsection{Part C}
1. $p_\mathscr{I} = N$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = N$.\\
2. $p_\mathscr{I} = \{n \in N$ $|$ $n$ is even$\}$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = \{n \in N$ $|$ $n$ is odd$\}$.\\
3. $p_\mathscr{I} = \{n \in N$ $|$ $n$ is odd$\}$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = \{n \in N$ $|$ $n$ is even$\}$.\\
4. $p_\mathscr{I} = \emptyset$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = \emptyset$

\subsection{Part D}
1. $p_\mathscr{I} = \{n \in N$ $|$ $n$ is even$\}$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = \{n \in N$ $|$ $n$ is odd$\}$.\\
2. $p_\mathscr{I} = \{n \in N$ $|$ $n$ is even$\}$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = N$.\\
3. $p_\mathscr{I} = N$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = \{n \in N$ $|$ $n$ is odd$\}$.\\
4. $p_\mathscr{I} = N$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = N$.

\subsection{Part E}
Let $p_\mathscr{I} = \{n \in N$ $|$ $n$ is even$\}$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = N$ then $q(s(s(zero)))$ is true but $p(s(zero))$ is false so the interpretation is a model of $F_1 \land F_2$ but not of $F_3$.

\subsection{Part F}
Since there is some model of $F_1 \land F_2$ which is not a model of $F_3$, $F_3$ is not a logical consequence of $F_1 \land F_2$.

\subsection{Part G}
The only interpretations of $p/1$ and $q/1$ which model $F_1 \land F_3$ are:\\
1. $p_\mathscr{I} = N$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = N$.\\
2. $p_\mathscr{I} = \{n \in N$ $|$ $n$ is even$\}$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = \{n \in N$ $|$ $n$ is odd$\}$.

These interpretations for $q/1$ also model $F_2$, so any interpretation which models $F_1 \land F_3$ will also model $F_2$.

\subsection{Part H}
$F_2$ is a logical consequence of $F_1 \land F_3$ by definition of logical consequence.

\section{Definite Programs}
\subsection{Part A}
$p_\mathscr{I} = \{(a, a)\}$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = \{(a, a)\}$.

\subsection{Part B}
1. $p_\mathscr{I} = \{(a, b), (b, c), (b, d)\}$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = \{(a, a), (b, b), (c, c), (d, d), (a, b), (b, c), (b, d), (a, c), (a, d)\}$.\\
2. $p_\mathscr{I} = \{(a, b), (b, c), (b, d)\}$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = \{(a, a), (b, b), (c, c), (d, d), (a, b), (b, c), (b, d), (a, c), (a, d), (c, d)\}$.

\subsection{Part C}
1. $p_\mathscr{I} = \{(a, b), (b, c), (b, d)\}$ and $q_\mathscr{I} = \{(a, a), (b, b), (c, c), (d, d), (a, b), (b, c), (b, d), (a, c), (a, d)\}$.

\subsection{Part D}
Let $P$ be a definite program, it will be shown that there exists some interpretation $\mathscr{I}$ which is a model of $P$.  More specifically, it will be shown that there exists a Herbrand model of $P$.  The Herbrand base of $P$ contains all ground atomic formulas over $P$ and as such the entire set $B_P$ will be a Herbrand model of $P$.

Assume that $B_P$ is not a Herbrand model of $P$.  Then there exists some clause $A_0 \leftarrow A_1, ..., A_n$ in $P$ such that all of the atoms $A_1, ..., A_n$ are true but $A_0$ is false under interpretation $\mathscr{I} = B_P$.  Then there is some ground instance of $A_0$ which is not true under $\mathscr{I}$.  But this implies that $B_P$ does not contain this ground instance of $A_0$ which contradicts the definition of a Herbrand base.

$\therefore$ $B_P$ is a Herband interpretation of $P$ and $P$ has an interpretation $\blacksquare$
